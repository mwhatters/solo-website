      Thanks for checking this out! My name's Marshall.
      I'm a person who is really passionate about music, video games,
      web development, and philosophy. I've had years of experience
        in the software world working for <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> but
        recently took time away to pursue composition and video game music development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since leaving Intercom in March 2019, I've taken the time to build audio engineering skills and learn a little bit more about audio game engines. 
      During this hiatus, I've also composed over 2 hours worth of original music, done extensive
      work in video game modding, brushed up on drumming and guitar, 
      and most importantly, took time to re-evaluate what it is I'm looking for in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I just moved down to San Diego, California, and in search for work!
      I have web development (ruby on rails, react, ember), music composition, and dynamic audio engineering experience.
      At this point I'm looking for work in any of those fields, though I have the most professional experience in software.

    In an effort to de-rust on React, I made this website. Consider this site a library of all of the projects I've done over the last few years.
    I'll continue to update it as I produce more work!
    I built this using the react framework Gatsby.
