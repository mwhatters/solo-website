      Thanks for checking this out! My name's Marshall.
      I'm a person who is really passionate about music, video games,
      web development, and philosophy. I've had years of experience
      in the software world working for <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> but
      took time away to pursue composition, video game development, and music production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since leaving Intercom in March 2019, I've taken the time to 
      build audio engineering skills and learn a little bit more about audio game engines. 
      During this hiatus, I've also composed over 4 hours worth of original music, done extensive
      work in video game modding, released a couple games, brushed up on drumming and guitar, 
      and most importantly, took time to re-evaluate what it is I'm looking for in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I moved down to San Diego, California, and am in search for work!
      I have experience with web development (ruby on rails, react, ember), game development (unity, godot, monogame), 
      music composition, and dynamic audio engineering.
      At this point I'm looking for work in any of those fields, 
      though I have the most professional experience in software.

      In an effort to de-rust on React, I made this website. It's deployed to a linode server
      using an automated deployment tool called TravisCI.
      Consider this site a library of all of the projects I've done over the last few years.
      I'll continue to update it as I produce more work!
      I built this using the react framework Gatsby.
