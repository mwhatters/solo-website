    <p>
      Hey thanks for checking this out! My name's Marshall,
      I'm a person who is really passionate about music, video games,
      web development, and philosophy. I've had years of experience
        in the software world working for <a href="https://www.intercom.com/">Intercom</a> but
        took time away to pursue composition and video game music development.
      </p>
    <p>
      Since leaving Intercom in March 2019, I spent time building audio engineering skills, familiarizing myself
      with dynamic music tools such as FMOD. During this time I've also composed over 2 hours worth of original music, done extensive
      work in video game modding, brushed up on drumming and guitar, and most importantly, took time to re-evaluate what it I'm looking for in life.
      </p>
    <p>
      I just moved down to San Diego, California, and in search for work!
      I have web development (ruby on rails, react, ember), music composition, and dynamic audio engineering experiennce.
      I built and hosted this website myself using the react framework Gatsby, and deployed via nginx.
      </p>
