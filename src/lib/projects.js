          Nameless pillars is a map created for celeste, with custom artwork, music, game elements, and gameplay all created by myself. A desert themed map with
          plenty of secrets!

          Don Muchacho is a game I developed with friends in a weekend for Ludum Dare 49. It was
          built using the Defold engine. In this project, I wrote the level transition system, pause menu,
          composed the music and sfx (implemented with fmod), and helped design some of the levels. We learned the engine as we made the Game
          during the weekend. This was probably a bad choice, as defold is a complex engine, but we had fun nonetheless.

          Surface Level is a game I developed with friends in a weekend for Ludum Dare 48. It was

        Glyph is a mod for the popular 2d platformer called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="http://www.celestegame.com/">Celeste</a> I made myself. It includes over 250 rooms of gameplay, 
        custom assets (mostly re-colors of base-game assets), 50+ minutes of original music, and a large amount of custom code (written with C#). It's one of the most
        popular mods released for the game yet, with over 180 thousand views and 4,000 downloads. It has been featured at high-profile
        speedrunning events, including <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zon5vP6qIo">Summer Games Done Quick</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This was one of the more affirming experiences I've ever had working with video game design. What most excited me was the
        use of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.fmod.com/">FMOD</a> to integrate a fully dynamic musical score with the gameplay. The gimmick of the map revolves around traveling through portals
        to different dimensions. In each dimension, a different ambience and set of instrumentation accompanies the change of scenery. This was both a compositional challenge in a addition to a technical one,
        but the results were very effective. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent an upwards of 4 months total on creating this mod. Most of that time was spent coding custom mechanics and adding gameplay levels. I wrote the score for the game
        in about 2 weeks.

          Luna is an original, full length 2d platformer I created in Unity over a 1.5 year period. It features the story of a character named Luna
          and their journey towards overcoming their creator and defeating his powerful minions. The game is built around the concept of being able to rotate the world you are moving through, 
          thus affecting the gravity of the player and surrounding objects.
          It was released in August of 2017 and was my first attempt at designing a video game from scratch.
          Given my limitations on both a technical and visual level, I'm ultimately proud of this effort.
