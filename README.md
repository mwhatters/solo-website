### my portfolio website

Visit the site at https://mwhatt.com/

This is a portfolio site I originally built in a week using [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)! It was primarily a de-rusting exercise but also an exploration of using the gatsby framework for the first time. Overall the framework is super enjoyable to work with. It features some information about myself, a lot of the projects that i've worked on, and links to other places where my work is featured. As I complete more projects I'll continue to add them to this website.

This site was made in a pretty hasty manner as I wanted to build something quickly that worked. As a result my commits are pretty unorganized, and there was definitely things I want to improve about the site. All of the assets were made by myself in photoshop. Most of the project art was also made by myself. 

### deployment


Use yarn to get yourself up and running with `yarn install`
To run the project in development, use `npm run develop`

This site uses [travisci](https://www.travis-ci.com) to auto deploy any changes to a [linode server](https://www.linode.com/) when i merge pull requests into master.

View a preview build with Netlify, you can find a link to it from the PR you make
